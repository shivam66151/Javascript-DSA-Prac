//Question:
// You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), 
// followed by one or more arguments. 
// Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments.

// Code Explanation -->

//Create an array of valsToRemove using Object.values(arguments).slice(1) and store it in the variable valsToRemove. 
//Weâ€™ll use this to check against arr.
// Start a basic for loop to iterate through arr. 
// Nest another for loop inside the first, changing the integer variable j and arr to valsToRemove. 
// This second loop will iterate through valsToRemove .
// Within the second loop create an if statement, checking strictly === that the current value of arr[i] is equal to valsToRemove[j].
// If the value at the current index is equal in both arrays, use delete to remove it from arr.
// Outside of the nested loops: return the modified array, filtering out any null's created by the delete operator.

function destroyer(arr) {
    let valsToRemove = Object.values(arguments).slice(1);
  
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < valsToRemove.length; j++) {
        if (arr[i] === valsToRemove[j]) {
          delete arr[i];
        }
      }
    }
    return arr.filter(item => item !== null);
  }
 console.log(destroyer([1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3], 2, 3))

//  The Object.values() method returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values, 
//  in the same order as that provided by a for...in loop. 
//  (The only difference is that a for...in loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well.)

// The arguments object is an object that stores all of the values passed to the function. 
// Python developers might think of JS object as a dictionary. The arguments object takes on the structure of a JSON Object.
